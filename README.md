# media-foci-tracker
This project focusing on developing a program that assesses and analyzes public trends across different countries and concocts a conclusion using Natural Language Processing. The approach is to implement NER and TF-IDF to get the result.

The step is as follow:

raw_data -> clean_text/text_data_zip

clean_sentences -> clean_text/output_clean_text

1. first sentence is title

sum_keywords_extract -> keywords_extraction for all news


data is a list of tuples (date, keywords)
