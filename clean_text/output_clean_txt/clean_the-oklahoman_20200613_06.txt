The Dallas-based investor's Sealy Industrial Partners LP, actually, sunk $ 21,550,000 back into industrial property here at the same time it appeared to be leaving the market in April.
It was one of three acquisitions totaling $100 million for a combined 1,775,927 square feet that Sealy executed in one week.
The others were in Kansas City, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee.
Sealy upgraded the quality of its holdings here, trading warehouse-distribution centers developed from 35 to nearly 50 years ago for several built well after the turn of the millennium.
Sealy said its latest investments "provide varying features and office finishes to the diverse range of creditworthy tenants who currently fully occupy them."
Sealy, with investments in Oklahoma City since 2014, sold nearly 20 big buildings totaling 2.1 million square feet in the industrial southwest part of the city as part of a nearly $1 billion disposition of property in 16 markets in the South and Midwest.
The structures were built f rom 1972 to 1985.
Then it acquired five others, fully leased, also near Will Rogers World Airport, with a combined footprint of
196,000 square feet for an average of $109.95 per square foot.
The structures were built from 2001 to 2015.
The off-market portfolio transaction was facilitated for the seller, Oklahoma City developer Mark Ru ff in, by brokers Brett Price and Kris Davis with Newmark G rub bL evy Strange Beffort.
Scott Sealy Jr. and Jason Gandy led the acquisition for Sea ly &Co.
The properties acquired were:
-Airport Business Center, 123,500 square feet of space in buildings at 3500 S MacArthur and 3600 S MacArthur, $14 million.
- Airport Commerce Center, 37,500 square feet in building sat 5700 SW 36 and 3801S Moulton, $3.7 million.
- One 35,000-squarefoot building at 4015 S Purdue, $3.85 million.
Major tenants in the portfolio include Emser Tile, Siemens, AD I, General Dynamics, and Tetra Tech.
Sealy noted in a press release that its new acquisitions, like the properties its old, are within 3 miles of the airport.
"This area has steadily solidified itself as an emerging logistics hub and a leader in the region due to its expanding population, skilled workforce, steady job growth, and a belowaverage cost of living.
Sealy & Co. is familiar with the area, as it has owned several properties adjacent to the newly acquired buildings in the past," Sealy said.
Sealy & Co. likes what it sees in Oklahoma City, said Gandy, who is the company' s managing director of investment services.
"We have been consistently and carefully sourcing deals for many years and have been fortunate to familiarize ourselves with some of our top target markets.
These Class A properties are in an ideal location in which we have previously owned and managed assets, and we are excited to establish more market presence here,‚Äù Gandy said.
