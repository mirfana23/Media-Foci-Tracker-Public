More than 30,000 residents in nursing homes killed in pandemic.
Thousands of eldercare facilities cite a lack of medical safety equipment and staff

New federal numbers released Thursday reflect the rising toll of nursing home deaths amid the coronavirus pandemic and the desperate need among some of the nation’s 15,000 facilities for personnel and basic supplies.
The national tally of nursing home deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus has reached nearly 32,000, and it’s sure to rise: About 12 percent of the homes have not yet reported figures.
The new figures also show 683 nursing home employees have died.
Thousands of facilities report being underequipped for the continuing onslaught from the virus.
Nearly 2,000 facilities reported a shortage of nursing staff; more than 2,200 lack enough aides, and more than 500 lack any supply of N95 masks used to prevent infection, according to the data.
More than 250 nursing homes lack any surgical masks and another 800 are within a week of running out.
The new figures build on data released Tuesday by federal regulators that showed about 25,000 residents had died after contracting the virus, but more nursing homes have reported data since then.
