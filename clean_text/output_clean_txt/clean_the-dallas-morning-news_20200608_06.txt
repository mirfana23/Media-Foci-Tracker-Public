Dallas County health officials reported 263 coronavirus cases Sunday — the 11th straight day with more than 200 cases.
The new number brings the countywide total to 12,093 cases.
Officials also reported two deaths related to COVID19: an Irving man in his 20s who had been critically ill at an area hospital but who had no underlying chronic health conditions and a Dallas woman in her 90s who was a resident of a longterm care facility.
Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said in a written statement Sunday that people who are participating in large group gatherings such as protests should maintain social distancing.
He also said people who are participating in protests can be tested for free.
“The tests are being done by Parkland and your information will not be shared with law enforcement,” Jenkins said.
“Please know your status to protect yourself, your family and the community.”
More than a third of the 264 deaths reported have been associated with longterm care facilities, officials said.
Of patients requiring hospitalization who reported employment, more than 80% have been what officials call “critical infrastructure workers.” Occupations for them include industries such as health care, transportation, food and agriculture.
