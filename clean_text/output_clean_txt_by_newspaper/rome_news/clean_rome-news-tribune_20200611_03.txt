Marjorie Greene, John Cowan to face off
¢ The 14th District GOP runoff is set for Aug. 11.
Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene and John Cowan are set to face off in August for their party’s nomination to succeed U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-ranger, who is not running for reelection.
The winner will be on the November ballot against Democrat Kevin Van Ausdal in the heavily conservative 14th Congressional District race.
The district covers 12 Northwest Georgia counties, including Floyd, Polk and Chattooga.
Greene, who owns a construction company in Alpharetta, won over 41% of the vote in the nine-person primary.
Cowan, a Rome neurosurgeon, was the runner-up with nearly 20%.
“T had one of the toughest races in the state, with strong opponents,” Greene said Wednesday.
“I’m really happy with 41%.”
For the runoff, she said, she will continue working to connect personally with voters across the district.
“It’s my first time running and I’m taking the same approach I do in business.
You talk to your customers,” she said.
In a statement released by her campaign, she said the runoff will be about “which candidate is going to fight harder against radical left Socialist Democrats trying to destroy the country.”
“President Trump needs me in Congress to have his back against these Socialist extremist pro-criminal Democrats and their radical anti-american agenda,” Greene said.
“Democrats are now the party of lawlessness.
They defend looters and rioters.
They want to cut our police.
And they want to open our borders.”
Cowan is positioning himself as “the homegrown candidate, born and raised in the 14th Congressional District, while Greene leased a place in Rome when she decided to shift her campaign from the 6th District.
“I’m running here because, for me, this is home.
Let’s
not forget: No matter what happens in this election, I’ll still live, work and raise my family in Northwest Georgia.”
He’s focusing his attention in the runoff on the roughly 58% of the voters who picked someone other than Greene.
“If your first choice didn’t make the runoff, call me.
I want to be your next first choice.” And Cowan is emphasizing his commitment to having “President Trump’s back in Congress,” while representing “my community’s conservative values.”
“I’m pro-life, pro-gun and pro-trump.
I’ll work to build the Wall, bring good jobs to our district and fix our broken healthcare system,” he said in a statement.
“There’s no shortage of show horses in Congress .
... We need someone who'll bring serious conservative solutions to save our country.”
The runoff is set for Aug. 11, with early voting starting July 20.
