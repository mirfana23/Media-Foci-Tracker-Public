Despite limitations imposed by the coronavi r us pandemic, many Oklahomans still managed to mark Memorial Day over the weekend.
At Memorial Park Cemetery, staff placed flags to honor military veterans.
The duty traditionally is handled by Boy Scouts, but the group was unable to perform the task this year.
Memorial Day, formerly known as Decoration Day, is a federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor and mourn the military personnel who died serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.
