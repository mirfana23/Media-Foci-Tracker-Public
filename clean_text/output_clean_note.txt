    # a proper sentence doesn't contain http/email. It contains less than 3*4-word letter.
    # after a blank, sentence must contain more than two words that have 3 letters.
    # while there is a continuation next line, go on as long as row < len(sents)
        # if sentence(row) ends with '-', and there is a sentence on next row
        # if there is a sentnce ends with -, but the next row is blank, wait until there is a proper sentence
            # sometimes 'http' in the middle, so wait till the continuation
        # combine the sentence set as paragraph
    #  finally use sentence_separator
