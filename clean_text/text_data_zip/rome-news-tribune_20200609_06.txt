Democratic Party questions

1. Should Georgians work to stop climate change and listen to the scientific community,
which recommends immediate action to combat this serious threat to our planet?

2. Should Georgia enact basic standards to protect our environment from wasteful plastic
items that pollute our state?

3. Should every eligible Georgian be allowed to register to vote on Election Day to make
sure everyone can exercise their right to vote?

4. Should Georgia take partisanship out of the redistricting process and have an indepen-
dent commission draw district lines instead of politicians?

5. Should our criminal justice system end the discriminatory cash bail system that allows
the wealthy to buy their way out of jail while disadvantaging lower income Georgians?

6. Should every Georgian that has served their sentence for a crime they committed be al-
lowed to have their voting rights restored?

Nonpartisan judicial races will also be on both parties’ ballots.
